# Why Docker

- Reproducible environment, removing works on my machine issues. Move between machines and analysts with ease.

- Partition tasks to their own environment, securing login credentials etc. 

- More task with the same resources (as docker uses a shared operating system.

- Docker containers lend themsevles to continuous integration and deployment

- Test deployments in production conditions with test databases etc. in the environment they will run in.

- Useful for open source projects like R where libraries are constantly being updated, potentially breaking your analysis.

#What is Docker

---
#[What is Docker](https://opensource.com/resources/what-docker)

*"Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers"*

##[What is a container](https://www.docker.com/what-container)

*"A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings"*

# The basics of Docker

---

#[ The Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/#the-docker-platform)

##Server 

Long running process known as a daemon

##REST API

Specifies  the interface

##Command line interface

Uses the REST API to control the daemon.

---

#Common commands

- What images do I have locally?


```bash
docker images
```

- What containers are running?


```bash
docker ps
```

- Get a new container


```bash
docker pull seabbs/fcdashboard
```

- Run a container


```bash
docker run -p 3838:3838 seabbs/fcdashboard
```

---

#Common commands

- How do I stop this container?


```bash
docker stop &lt;container-id&gt;
```

- How do I remove this container?


```bash
docker rm &lt;container-id&gt;
```

#Building a Dockerfile

---

#Choosing a base image

- Dockerfiles can be built from scratch but it is better to base a container on a community maintained one.

## Funding Circle

```bash
FROM quay.io/fundingcircle/alpine-envconsul:3.7
```
---

#Choosing a base image

## [Rocker](https://hub.docker.com/u/rocker/)

```bash
## Rstudio server
FROM rocker/rstudio
## Rstudio Server with tidyverse packages
FROM rocker/tidyverse
## Shiny server
FROM rocker/shiny

## Version controlled R image - tagged to 3.4.4 (uses MRAN)
rocker/r-ver:3.4.4
```

---

#Choosing a base image

## [Jupyter](https://hub.docker.com/u/jupyter/) 


```bash
## Jupyter notebook - many other variants
FROM jupyter/datascience-notebook
```

## Other 

- Docker hub contains prebuilt community maintained images for many other systems. Often the easiest method to install software/packages such as Selenium, Tensorflow, databses etc.
---

# Installing libraries and R packages


```bash
## Get libs required by packages
RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; \
    apt-get install -y \
    libssl-dev \
    libcurl4-openssl-dev \
    libssh2-1-dev \
    libnlopt0 \
    libnlopt-dev \
    libudunits2-dev \
    libxml2-dev \
    libgdal-dev \
    libproj-dev \
    &amp;&amp; apt-get clean

## Install R packages - MRAN
RUN Rscript -e 'install.packages(c("pkgconfig", "irlba", "igraph", "shinydashboard"))'

RUN Rscript -e 'install.packages(c("shinyBS", "shinyWidgets", "tidyverse", "DT", "rmarkdown"))'

RUN Rscript -e 'install.packages(c( "e1071", "caret", "ggfortify", "plotly", "lubridate", "wrapr", "stringr"))'
```

---

# Add files, setting work directories, exposing ports, and running a command


```bash
ADD . home/fcdashboard

WORKDIR  home/fcdashboard

EXPOSE 3838

## Create log file
CMD Rscript -e 'shiny::runApp(port = 3838, host = "0.0.0.0")'
```

---

#[The full dockerfile](https://github.com/seabbs/fcdashboard/blob/master/Dockerfile)

- Full example dockerfile available on GitHub.

#Running the example


```bash
# If in local directory
docker build . -t fcdashboard
# If stored as an image in the cloud (here docker hub)
docker pull seabbs/fcdashboard

docker run -d -p 3838:3838 seabbs/fcdashboard

## Mounting a volume..... or use -v to mount a volume... see docs.
--mount type=bind,source=$(pwd)/data/,target=/home/rstudio/fcdashboard/data
```

#Docker compose

---

#Docker compose

## [What is docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/)

*"Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration"*

## Why docker compose

- Specify ports, environment files, volumes to mount and containers to link together.
---

#Common commands

- build containers?


```bash
docker-compose build
```

- Launch containers


```bash
docker-compose up
```

- Bring down containers


```bash
docker-compose down
```

---
## [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/FundingCircle/uk-data-scripts/blob/master/dwh_import/docker-compose.yml)


```bash
version: '3'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:9.6

  fcadb:
    image: quay.io/fundingcircle/postgres-with-data-uat:latest

  dwh_importer:
    build: .
    links:
      - fcadb
      - db
    env_file: 'docker-compose.env'
    
```

---

## [docker-compose.env](https://github.com/FundingCircle/uk-data-scripts/blob/master/dwh_import/docker-compose.yml)


```bash
FCA_HOST=fcadb
FCA_PORT=5432
FCA_DBNAME=fundingcircle
FCA_USER=wwwfc
FCA_PW=
DWH_HOST=db
DWH_PORT=5432
DWH_DBNAME=warehouse

# Continuous integration and Docker

---

# Container registries

- Store built images for sharing

- Some can also autmatically build images from Dockerfiles

- Personal experiance: Docker Hub

- Funding Circle: Quay.io


---

# [Docker hub](https://www.google.com/search?q=docker+hub)

- Not used by Funding Circle?

- Provides a public registry of docker images

- Can [automate builds](https://hub.docker.com/r/seabbs/gettbinr/) from GitHub Repos can be set up, removing issue of local build time.

---

## [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/)

- Contains all FC docker apps

- Building handled by [circleci](https://circleci.com/?utm_source=gb&amp;utm_medium=SEM&amp;utm_campaign=SEM-gb-200-Eng-ni&amp;utm_content=SEM-gb-200-Eng-ni-CircleCI&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpca5jcie2wIVS5PtCh2mxg1CEAAYASAAEgIJ2_D_BwE)

---

## [CircleCI for Docker container deployment](https://github.com/FundingCircle/uk-data-scripts/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml)

- Used by FC to build containers in the cloud

- Tests are run

- If passed container is pushed to quay.io

- Can then be scheduled using the cluster

---
class: center, middle, inverse

#Issues

---

#Issues

- Within FC recommended to use `quay.io/fundingcircle/alpine-envconsul:3.7` as a base image

- Alpine often used due to size.

- This does not suport R, python etc. natively.

- Advantage is ability to add secrets? Although this should be possible with other images...

- Adding version controlled R and rstudio server is difficult. I have implemented [R](https://github.com/FundingCircle/risk-model-dashboards/blob/offerratetracker/offerratetracker/docker-config/containers/r-alpine/Dockerfile) but this is not yet available from quay. 

- For analysts using other base images would be preferable.

- Can normal users push to quay, schedule automated builds from GitHub for analysis in development?

#Examples

---

# Rstudio server with tidyverse


```bash
docker pull rocker/tidyverse

docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -e USER=seabbs -e PASSWORD=seabbs --name rstudio rocker/tidyverse
```

---

# Jupyter notebook


```bash
docker pull jupyter/datascience-notebook

docker run -d -p 8888:8888 jupyter/datascience-notebook
```

---

# Shiny app


```bash
docker pull seabbs/fcdashboard

docker run -d -p 8787:8787 seabbs/fcdashboard
```

--- 

# Aside - [ShinyProxy](https://www.shinyproxy.io)

- Open source alternative to shiny server

- Each app is packaged as a docker container

- Manage access etc natively

- Scale with no restrictions

- Compatible with clusters (i.e docker swarm/kubernetes)

---

--- 

# Scheduling processes in a container

##Steps:

- Write a script that pulls data, transforms and then pushes
- Set up a script to launch job at desired time limit
- Write dockerfile with all dependencies
- CMD to run scheduling script and hold open container
- Push docker container to registry
- Pull docker image and launch. 

##Example:

- [Example](https://github.com/seabbs/TweetRstudioCheatsheets)
- [Output](https://twitter.com/daily_r_sheets)

# Scheduling processes using containers and a external manager

- Managers include: Kubernetes, Jenkins, CRON scheduling

##Steps:

- Write a script that pulls data, transforms and then pushes
- Write dockerfile with all dependencies
- Push to registry
- Get job scheduled

##Example:

- [Example](https://github.com/FundingCircle/uk-data-scripts/tree/master/dwh_import)

# Wrap-up

- Using docker for all analysis ensures that work is reproducible and easy to push to production.

- Allows the analyst/data scientist to easily spin up the same environment on any compute resource.

- Makes sharing work easier and quicker.

- Makes using continuous integration and testing much easier.

- FC makes good use of docker for production, introducing it to analysis process might improve knowledge sharing etc.

- Several issues to iron out before easy to use docker for analysis at FC.
